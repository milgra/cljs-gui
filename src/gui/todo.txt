clojure forces you to do fantastic things!!! instead of fucking up the code because of laziness you have to think everything out. you still can throw in dozens of function calls after each other beacuse of laziness to do something but the code immediately will be unmaintainable so you will start to not doing it
clojure/script - forces you to think, to not program lazily (no mid-return, no mid-declarations, makes you realize that a function does too much - getting coordinates from a texmap shouldn't add non-existing texture, beacuse it has to return a new texmap aaand the result also which looks terrible )
get/create tex from array helyett gen then get mert az allapottal mindig vissza kell terni
nincs megosztott fuggveny - id for/create nem keverheto, eloszor create all texures, aztan id
it has hundreds of useful core functions - they are done by macros! they don't extend the specs of the language

at any time you can print the state of your program in a human-readable form
